## Lecture

This lecture comprises two parts:

**Part 1: Assessing normality with three or more independent groups and the Kruskal-Wallis test**

Part 1 covers how to assess the assumption of normality with three or more independent groups. It also covers the theory behind the Kruskal-Wallis test, how to calculate the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic manually, how to run the test in R,  how to interpret the output, and how to conduct post-hoc comparisons.

## Lab preparation

Before the lab, please watch the following video. This walks you through how to perform Friedman's ANOVA in R.

Please also take a look at this R markdown file. This covers how to run a Kruskal-Wallis test and Friedman's ANOVA in R:  

## Lab

In the lab, we'll practice running a Kruskal-Wallis test and Friedman's ANOVA in R. Please download the following zip file which contains two datasets: "course_data_set.csv" and "memory_data.csv". 

The datasets relate to the following research questions:

**1. Course dataset**

You are a psychology lecturer. You hear that the library is offering three statistics courses. You are interested in whether students who attend the courses perform significantly differently from each other.

You recruit 18 people and assign each one to a course. After the courses are finished, you ask them to write an R script. You time how long it takes students to complete the task. You are interested in whether there is a significant effect of course on the time taken to complete the task.

**2. Memory dataset**

You are a developmental psychologist. You are interested in whether working memory develops between 15 and 17 years of age.

You recruit a sample of adolescents and test them on a working memory task when they are 15 years of age, 16 years of age, and 17 years of age. 

You then examine whether there is a significant effect of age on working memory score.

## Lab - model script

Here is a model script that produces the answers to the above research questions. I use the word 'model' loosely, as you may have used different functions you've learned over the last two years (and that's absolutely fine!). So don't worry if you haven't used the exact same functions as me. You should end up with the same results and interpretation at the end though.

### Course data:

```{r }
library(cowplot)
library(FSA)
library(PMCMRplus)
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r include=FALSE}
recode <- dplyr::recode
select <- dplyr::select
```

#### Read in the data

This chunk reads in the data.

```{r}
course_data <- read.csv("course_data_set.csv")
```

#### Check whether the data meets the assumption of normality

Remember, we need to check if the assumption of normality is met for each group separately.

##### Course 1

###### Filter data:

This produces a new dataset containing data for the Course 1 group only:

```{r}
course_1 <- course_data %>% filter(Group == "Course 1")
```

###### Produce a Q-Q plot:

```{r}
qqnorm(course_1$Time)
qqline(course_1$Time, col = "steelblue")
```

Quite a few of the datapoints deviate from the line, suggesting data from this group might violates the assumption of normality.

###### Shapiro-Wilk test:


```{r}
shapiro.test(course_1$Time)
```

This suggests that the data in the course 1 group violates the assumption of normality.

##### Course 2:

###### Filter data:

This produces a new dataset containing data for the Course 2 group only:

```{r}
course_2 <- course_data %>% filter(Group == "Course 2")
```

###### Produce a Q-Q plot:


```{r}
qqnorm(course_2$Time)
qqline(course_2$Time, col = "steelblue")
```

The points do generally follow the line, although there is some slight deviation.

###### Shapiro-Wilk test:

```{r}
shapiro.test(course_2$Time)
```

The Shapiro-Wilk test is not significant, suggesting the data does not violate the assumption of normality.

##### Course 3:

###### Filter data:

This produces a new dataset containing data for the Course 3 group only:

```{r}
course_3 <- course_data %>% filter(Group == "Course 3")
```

###### Produce a Q-Q plot:


```{r}
qqnorm(course_3$Time)
qqline(course_3$Time, col = "steelblue")
```

Quite a few of the points deviate from the line. 

###### Shapiro-Wilk test:

```{r}
shapiro.test(course_3$Time)
```

The Shapiro-Wilk test suggests that data in this group violates the assumption of normality.

###### Interpretation:

Data from the Course 1 and Course 3 groups appears to violates the assumption of normality. Data from the Course 2 group does not appear to violate the assumption. We might therefore decide to run the Kruskal-Wallis test. 

#### Exploring our dataset:

First, let's explore the data.

##### Descriptive statistics:

Medians, range, and number of participants per group:

```{r}
course_data %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% # plots data per group
  summarise(med = median(Time), # median  
            min = min(Time), # lowest value
            max = max(Time), # highest value
            n = n()) # number of participants per group
```

Plot:

```{r}
ggplot(course_data, aes(x=Group, y=Time)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(y = "Time spent completing the task (minutes)") + 
  theme_cowplot() 
```

The median for the Course 3 group is lowest, Course 2 is intermediate, and Course 1 is highest. There are 6 participants in each group


#### Performing the Kruskal-Wallis test:

```{r}
model1 <- kruskal.test(Time ~ Group, data = course_data)
model1
```

From this, we can see that there is a significant difference between the groups.

#### Post-hoc tests:

Post-hoc tests were therefore conducted to understand which groups significantly differ from each other.

```{r}
dunnTest(Time~Group,data=course_data, method = "holm")
```

Here, we can see that the difference between Course 1 and Course 3 is significant.

#### Interpretation:

There was a significant effect of course on the amount of time required to complete the task, *H*(2) = 7.77, *p* = .020. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted using Dunn’s test. P-values were corrected using Bonferroni-Holm. There was a significant difference between Course 1 (median = 64, range = 21-70) and Course 3 (median = 8.50, range = 5-31; *p* = .016), with students who completed Course 3 completing the task faster. No significant difference emerged between Course 1 and Course 2 (median = 25.5, range = 15-36; *p* = 0.303), or Course 2 and Course 3 (*p* = .176).

###  Memory data:

#### Read in the data

This chunk reads in the data.

```{r}
memory_data <- read.csv("memory_data.csv") 
```

#### Check whether the data meets the assumption of normality

##### Timepoint 1 (Age 15):

###### Produce a Q-Q plot:


```{r}
qqnorm(memory_data$Age_15)
qqline(memory_data$Age_15, col = "steelblue")
```

Some of the points deviate quite a lot from the line. This suggests the assumption of normality may be violated. 

###### Shapiro-Wilk test:

```{r}
shapiro.test(memory_data$Age_15)
```

The Shapiro-Wilk test is significant, suggesting the assumption of normality is violated.

##### Timepoint 2 (Age 16):

###### Produce a Q-Q plot:

```{r}
qqnorm(memory_data$Age_16)
qqline(memory_data$Age_16, col = "steelblue")
```

The points generally follow the line well.  

###### Shapiro-Wilk test:

```{r}
shapiro.test(memory_data$Age_16)
```

The Shapiro-Wilk test is non-significant and most of the points follow the line, suggesting the assumption of normality is  not violated.

##### Timepoint 3 (Age 17):

###### Produce a Q-Q plot:

```{r}
qqnorm(memory_data$Age_17)
qqline(memory_data$Age_17, col = "steelblue")
```

The points deviate from the line quite a bit. 

###### Shapiro-Wilk test:

```{r}
shapiro.test(memory_data$Age_17)
```

The Shapiro-Wilk test is significant, suggesting the assumption of normality may have been violated.

###### Interpretation:

Data from the Age_15 and Age_17 timepoints appears to violate the assumption. A Friedman's ANOVA will therefore be run. 

#### Exploring the data:

##### Examining the descriptive statistics:

Median, minimum, maximum per condition: 

```{r}
memory_data %>%
  summarise(med_Age_15 = median(Age_15), med_Age_16 = median(Age_16), med_Age_17 = median(Age_17), 
            min_Age_15 = min(Age_15), min_Age_16 = min(Age_16), min_Age_17 = min(Age_17),
            max_Age_15 = max(Age_15), max_Age_16 = max(Age_16), max_Age_17 = max(Age_17),
            n = n()) # n only need to be calculated once since each participant contributes data to all three conditions 
```

##### Data visualisation:

```{r}
memory_data_long <- gather(memory_data, Age_group, Score, Age_15:Age_17) # coverts the data to long format
memory_data_long

memory_data_long$Age_group <- recode(memory_data_long$Age_group, "Age_15" = "15 years old",   # changes the factor level names
                                     "Age_16" = "16 year old",
                                     "Age_17" = "17 year old") 
```

```{r}
ggplot(memory_data_long, aes(x=Age_group, y=Score)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(y = "Working memory score", x = "Age group") + # adds a y label which makes it clearer what our outcome measure is
  theme_cowplot() # formats the figure nicely
```

Here, we can see there is very little difference between the medians of the 15 and 16 year old groups. There is a large difference between the 15 and 17 year olds and the 16 and 17 year olds.

#### Performing the Friedman's ANOVA

```{r}
# creates a new dataframe containing all columns except from the "Participant" column 
memory_data_reduced <- memory_data %>% select(-Participant) 
```

Run the model:

```{r}
model2 <- friedman.test(as.matrix(memory_data_reduced)) 
model2
```

The p-value is equal to 0.001 (if we round to three decimal places), indicating there is a significant effect of age group. 

#### Post-hoc tests

```{r}
# requires PMCMRplus library
frdAllPairsConoverTest(memory_data_long$Score, memory_data_long$Age_group, memory_data_long$Participant, p.adjust = "holm")
```
The post-hoc tests revealed a significant difference between the Age_15 and Age_17 timepoints, and the Age_16 and Age_17 timepoints. There is no significant difference between the Age_15 and Age_16 timepoints.

#### Interpretation:

Friedman’s ANOVA revealed that there was a significant effect of age group on working memory score, $x^{2}_{F}$(2) = 14.00, *p* = .001. Post-hoc comparisons were then conducting using the Conover test. P-values were corrected using Bonferroni-Holm. There was a significant difference between performance at 15 year of age (median = 40; range = 10-48) and 17 years of age (median = 66; range = 62-87; *p* = 0.008), and 16 years of age (median = 42; range = 16-66) and 17 years of age (*p* = 0.024). Participants performed significantly better at the 17 year old timepoint relative to the 15 and 16 year old timepoint. No significant difference emerged between the 15 year old and 16 year old timepoints (*p* = 0.490).

## Worksheet:

The answers are in the next section.

### Activity 1: Understanding how the non-parametric tests differ and when to use them

It is really important that you understand which statistical test you should run in different situations. This activity will test your knowledge of the statistical tests you learned during this lecture and {#wilcoxon-rank-sum-signed-rank}.

In each of the following scenario, you are interested in whether the type of chocolate eaten affects feelings of contentment (response = 0-100). For each scenario, think about the following questions:

**Scenario 1: You recruit 20 participants. On day 1, they eat milk chocolate. On day 2, they eat dark chocolate. On day 3, they eat white chocolate.**

a) How would you check whether the assumption of normality is violated for this design?

b) If the assumption of normality is violated, which non-parametric test would you run?

**Scenario 2: You recruit 12 participants and randomly assign them to either a “white chocolate”, “milk chocolate”, or “dark chocolate” group.**

a) How would you check whether the assumption of normality is violated for this design?

b) If the assumption of normality is violated, which non-parametric test would you run?

**Scenario 3: You recruit 7 participants. On day 1, they eat milk chocolate and on day 2, they eat dark chocolate.**

a) How would you check whether the assumption of normality is violated for this design?

b) If the assumption of normality is violated, which non-parametric test would you run?

**Scenario 4: You recruit 10 participants and randomly assign them to either a “white chocolate” or “milk chocolate” group.**

a) How would you check whether the assumption of normality is violated for this design?

b) If the assumption of normality is violated, which non-parametric test would you run?

### Activity 2: Interpreting R output

Interpret the following R output. Part 1 uses an independent groups design, whilst part 2 uses a repeated measures design.

#### Part 1: An independent groups design

You are a developmental researcher interested in whether the books children are exposed to affects their language production (how many words they can say). You recruit 21 2-year-old children and assign them to one of three groups – “Pinocchio”, “Cinderella”, and “Gruffalo”. The children’s parents then read this story every day for three months (i.e. children in the “Gruffalo” group read the Gruffalo every day). You then ask their parents to complete a language production assessment on their child (score = 0-100). 

##### Testing the assumption of normality:

###### Group 1: 
```{r echo = FALSE}
data <- read.csv("l7_worksheet1.csv")

Pinocchio <- data %>% filter(Book == "Pinocchio")

qqnorm(Pinocchio$Words)
qqline(Pinocchio$Words, col = "steelblue")

shapiro.test(Pinocchio$Words)
```

###### Group 2: 
```{r echo = FALSE}
Cinderella <- data %>% filter(Book == "Cinderella")

qqnorm(Cinderella$Words)
qqline(Cinderella$Words, col = "steelblue")

shapiro.test(Cinderella$Words)
```

###### Group 3: 
```{r echo = FALSE}
Gruffalo <- data %>% filter(Book == "Gruffalo")

qqnorm(Gruffalo$Words)
qqline(Gruffalo$Words, col = "steelblue")

shapiro.test(Gruffalo$Words)
```

Is the assumption violated?

##### Interpret the descriptive statistics and the model output

```{r echo = FALSE}
data %>%
  group_by(Book) %>%
  summarise(med_words = median(Words),
            min_words = min(Words),
            max_words = max(Words))

model1 <- kruskal.test(Words ~ Book, data = data)
model1

dunnTest(Words~Book,data=data, method = "holm")
```

What can we conclude? Report in APA format.

#### Part 2: A repeated measures design

You are a researcher interested in whether the number of hours sleep individuals get affects their performance on an attention task (score = 0-100). You recruit nine participants, with all participants taking part in three conditions. In the first condition, participants get 6 hours sleep the night before (6 hours). In the second condition, they get 8 hours sleep the night before (8 hours), and in the third condition, they get 10 hours sleep the night before (10 hours).

##### Testing the assumption of normality:

6 hours condition:

```{r echo = FALSE}
sleep_data <- read.csv("l7_worksheet2.csv")
qqnorm(sleep_data$six_hours)
qqline(sleep_data$six_hours, col = "steelblue")

shapiro.test(sleep_data$six_hours)
```

8 hours condition:

```{r echo = FALSE}
qqnorm(sleep_data$eight_hours)
qqline(sleep_data$eight_hours, col = "steelblue")

shapiro.test(sleep_data$eight_hours)
```

10 hours condition:

```{r echo = FALSE}
qqnorm(sleep_data$ten_hours)
qqline(sleep_data$ten_hours, col = "steelblue")

shapiro.test(sleep_data$ten_hours)
```

Is the assumption violated?

##### Interpret the descriptive statistics and the model output

```{r echo = FALSE}
sleep_data_reduced <- sleep_data %>% select(-Participant)

sleep_data_long <- gather(sleep_data, Condition, Score, six_hours:ten_hours) # coverts the data to long format
sleep_data_long

model2 <- friedman.test(as.matrix(sleep_data_reduced)) # remember this needs to be loaded in as a matrix
model2

frdAllPairsConoverTest(sleep_data_long$Score, sleep_data_long$Condition, sleep_data_long$Participant, p.adjust = "holm")

sleep_data %>%
  summarise(med_six_hours = median(six_hours), med_eight_hours = median(eight_hours), med_ten_hours = median(ten_hours), 
            min_six_hours = min(six_hours), min_eight_hours = min(eight_hours), min_ten_hours = min(ten_hours),
            max_six_hours = max(six_hours), max_eight_hours = max(eight_hours), max_ten_hours = max(ten_hours))
```
